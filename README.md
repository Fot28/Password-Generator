# Password-Generator

## Description

Given a Password-Generator Project, I used JavaScript to make a Password Generator that you can use to make a password with options of its character
length and as many different character types as you want to use from Numbers, Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters and Special characters.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Password-Generator Project open the website link and click on the Generate Password button to begin inserting the needed options. There you will see Prompt windows on the top of the webpage asking to insert your desired options and guiding you through the end also alerting you in case you insert something wrong. In the end, you will be able to see
the auto-generated password at the center of the page.
